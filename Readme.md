Part 2: Variables of interest. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Part 3: Labels for activities. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Part 4: Cleaning variable names. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Part 5: Avarages of each variable. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
